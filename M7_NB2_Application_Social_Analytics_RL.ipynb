    "The collection of multi-modal and diverse ranges of signals allows us to better understand network modalities and surface patterns that are difficult to observe or extract from noisy or dirty data. Populations, and the patterns they exhibit, are complex by definition, and there is no one-size-fits-all method to approach different studies. Typically, you would start your study with physical sensors, before extending your data set with social (and other) data to better understand the community or group being studied. In many cases, it is difficult to motivate for large-scale data collection processes to be initiated, but data generated for other purposes can be reused to build and extend analyses. Data from the telecommunications industry is a rich source of insight into human behavior, and has been found to be useful in a wide range of topics across multiple fields. This notebook briefly looks at some of these use cases. Using data generated as output of other processes introduces risks (such as changes in the processes that generate the data), but offers the ability to perform analyses that were previously impossible.\n",

The “Friends and Family” study uses multi-modal data sets. You have also been supplied with additional examples of data sets utilized in other studies. Physical data, sensor data, or survey data can be difficult or expensive to obtain. Although social network data may be easier to obtain, it carries inherent risks.

    "\n",
    "> A successful healthcare intervention is about the ability to target monitoring and vaccination of people with the highest probability of spreading a disease. A common approach is to consider densely connected subpopulations, such as schools, universities or hospitals, as they usually play a major early role in large epidemic outbreaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, another good approach is to consider all individuals with high centrality in social networks as good candidates for vaccination in a healthcare intervention. Some points to note are:\n",
    ">>*\tAlthough physical networks are the best, they are usually costly and may not be feasible. Hence, where social networks are available, they provide an accessible proxy of the structure of contacts among individuals.\n",
    ">>*\tAlthough all centrality measures are good approximations, individuals with high closeness centrality measure are the best ones to go for in an immunization strategy, because of their higher chances of physical contact with other individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) What is the most important physical aspect that needs to be accounted for or validated?\n",
    ">The most important physical aspect that needs to be accounted for or validated is the nature of the epidemic, if it has a dependency on physical proximity of individuals.\n",
    ">>* Generally, the algorithm to target vaccination of people with high centrality is robust with temporal effects. However, for spatial effects, it is important to consider the details of the pathogen spreading mechanism, when such policies are applied.\n",
    ">>* Diseases that require very close encounters (droplet spreading) can be effectively contained, whereas in cases of long-range transmissions (airborne diseases) targeted individuals with high network centrality play a less important role during an outbreak.\n"

The GFT analytics were overfitting a small number of cases, such as weeding out seasonal search terms. Moreover, there was temporal auto-correlation errors introduced into the analytics, eg: when last week’s errors were used to predict this week’s errors. These patterns mean that GFT overlooks considerable information that could be extracted by traditional statistical methods\n",

The changes in Google’s search algorithm and user behavior have affected GFT’s tracking. For example, recommended searches, usually based on what others have searched, will increase the relative magnitude of certain searches.

    "\n",
    "In his explanation of how big data may be applied in Human Resources (HR), Arek Stopczynski discusses sociometric badges, face-to-face contact, and privacy considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big data studies that have appropriate interventions can play a significant role in ensuring a more effective, productive, and happy workforce. These studies are often highly sensitive to privacy considerations due to the short time frame between observation and potential impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Privacy\n",
    "In the video content, Stopczynski also asks whether or not you care (or should care) if a random company knows where you are at any given point in time (for example, a free application on your cellphone requiring location data), and whether your feelings would change if said company was the company that you work for. Many applications where you share your data can also be used to gain insights into aspects of your life that you may not be comfortable sharing with your employer. This is because some of these insights can be taken out of context, resulting in privacy violations and subsequent loss of trust. Consider [Pokemon Go](https://www.reffind.com/pokemon-go-says-employees/) as an application that can potentially be used to gain insights about you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Trust\n",
    "A recent talk by one of Gartner’s analysts, Frank Buytendijk, stated that trust is an emotion. He said, “It is the confidence people have in your future behavior” (Gartner 2015). He then went on to say that “algorithms allow companies to trust people to the exact level they deserve: dynamically and at scale. Trust goes two ways. People must trust your business too, to connect to you. It is the confidence people have in your future behavior” (Gartner 2015).\n",

    "The five key dynamics to trust are:\n",
    "* Structure and clarity;\n",
    "* Psychological safety;\n",
    "* Dependability;\n",
    "* Meaning; and\n",
    "* Impact.\n",
