    "# Notebook introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "While you have been introduced to the many technical concepts, tools, and technologies, little attention has been paid to people and processes. These are critical elements to consider when undertaking projects using data. Technological advances mean that tools and data collection methods are becoming more accessible, and that projects that previously required significant investment (in terms of human resources and technology) can be undertaken by a wider range of audiences. Your use cases and reasons for undertaking projects will vary, but you will still need to interact with a variety of stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces a big data project methodology that will allow you to set up big data projects in your own social or commercial context. The existing project is used to demonstrate some of the key concepts that you can use as input in setting up your own projects in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video content, Professor Pentland referred to specific concepts that can also be applied to your project. Some of these include the following:\n",
    "- Creating social context, which involves surrounding people with others who are thinking about trying certain things in order to get them to adopt those behaviors.\n",
    "- Playing with ideas does not change behavior.\n",
    "- Implementing multiple strategies, which may be necessary in order to deal with the various parties in the social context (early adopters and close networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> While the content introduced in this course aims to provide you with insights typically applied in social analytics projects, you can also use these insights  to ensure the successful completion of your project. For example, projects where multiple parties work on similar projects with a shared vision typically have a higher likelihood of success than those performed by individuals in isolation. From a systems point of view, this can be attributed to items such as shared tasks (data collected once and used multiple times). However, people often underestimate the impact of social context when executing projects. Keep all of the content introduced in the course in mind while working through the content presented in this notebook, and ensure that you apply these concepts when setting up or interacting with other parties in your future endeavors.\n",

    "> We introduce the Friends and Family study, a longitudinal living laboratory in a residential community. In this study, we employ a ubiquitous computing approach, Social Functional Mechanism-design and Relationship Imaging, or Social fMRI, that combines extremely rich data collection with the ability to conduct targeted experimental interventions with study populations. We present our mobile-phone-based social and behavioral sensing system, deployed in the wild for over 15 months. Finally, we present three investigations performed during the study, looking into the connection between individuals’ social behavior and their financial status, network effects in decision making, and a novel intervention aimed at increasing physical activity in the subject population. Results demonstrate the value of social factors for choice, motivation, and adherence, and enable quantifying the contribution of different incentive mechanisms. \n",

    "# 1. Project overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a \"People, Process, Technology, Data\", high-level view of projects can be useful when planning or communicating projects at a conceptual level. Most project management methodologies will contain similar elements to those depicted in the following image (SAS Institute 2012).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<img src=\"peopleprocesstechnology.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 People\n",
    "Reuse existing skills, and budget time and training for your human resources. Many aspects of big data projects require additional learning curves and training. The nature of the types of analyses performed means that it is an iterative process, by definition, and many of the steps involved are extremely difficult to budget for using traditional project management methodologies. Ensure that you have the relevant skills available, and that you deal with the introduction of new tools and methodologies appropriately. Make sure that the analysts work in an environment where other members in the organization can support them, or that said analysts work with tools where there is a rich community of support (social context).\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical roles include the following:\n",
    "- **Stakeholders and decision makers:** Within an organization, this includes chief information officers (CIOs), chief data officers (CDOs), governance and compliance officers, and business unit representatives. Within academia, this includes lecturers and study leads or department representatives of the institution.\n",
    "- **Analytics professionals:** This includes data scientists who create new functions and perform ad hoc analyses (typically using scripting languages such as R and Python, but may also use other existing tools where appropriate), and data scientists and analysts who repeat and refine analyses. This is similar to the above step, but also typically includes the use of more accessible tools such as Structured Query Language (SQL) and business intelligence (BI) tools. Business analysts and knowledge workers are supported by data analysts and data scientists, and typically use apps and end-to-end tools.\n",
    "- **Infrastructure specialists:** This includes architects, database administrators, and system owners.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Process\n",
    "The “process” component of projects refers to the following aspects:\n",
    "1. Defining the processes and implementing standards to ensure that your activities are repeatable.\n",
    "2. Adhering to the standards (academic or commercial) required by your organization. \n",
    "3. Meeting the requests of your analytics needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Academics have a well-defined and rigorous process in place to deal with many of the issues that may arise. In the business and commercial world, many organizations are moving from waterfall-based approaches to more agile and \"fail-fast\" or \"[data-driven approaches](http://andrewchen.co/know-the-difference-between-data-informed-and-versus-data-driven/)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Technology\n",
    "The “technology” component of projects is characterized by the need to:\n",
    "- Choose the analytics platform components as required; \n",
    "- Reuse and be critical of limitations; \n",
    "- Consider open ecosystems and environments that can be used to speed up progress; and\n",
    "- Perform due diligence prior to implementing in production, as the checks and balances exist for a reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful of moving to this step too quickly. Resolve the function and architecture before making technology choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Data\n",
    "The “data” component of projects involves carrying out the following three steps:\n",
    "1. Identify, acquire, store, and provide access to the data required to support your analytics needs.\n",
    "2. Apply the appropriate governance and privacy protection standards.\n",
    "3. Use the data to uncover insights, trends, and patterns from data.\n"

    "\n",
    "Approaching projects purely from a technical or analytical point of view often delivers underwhelming results. Be aware that once you reach an insight, you will also have to act on that insight, and that action needs to be performed in the social context of your organization or environment. This may be in the form of a simple change in an existing business process. However, in many cases, it may be necessary to implement significant changes in existing processes, new processes, or products and services that require some form of change management in order to implement the proposed changes. Review topics around [organizational transformation](http://www.iienet2.org/Details.aspx?id=24456) and “data-driven approaches” for further information and guidance.\n",
    "Many of the approaches advocate iterative or “fail-fast” approaches in order to test the concept before embarking on full-scale projects.

Imagine the ability to record and display nearly every facet and dimension of behavior, communication, and social interaction among the members of the said community. Moreover, envision being able to conduct interventions in the community, while measuring their effect — by both automatic sensor tools as well as qualitative assessment of the individual subjects.

    "Starting with a clearly-stated and referenceable vision is a good way to ensure that you can communicate the project’s intention to multiple stakeholders, and get them excited and focused on the topic being studied. When setting the vision, keep the potential stakeholders and decision makers in mind. This is usually championed by an individual, but may form part of formal structures such as thesis proposals or workshops with multiple potential stakeholders. In terms of your documentation, abstracts, introductions, and overviews are typically completed last as these items are frequently revisited and updated throughout the course of the project.\n",

    "In the video content, earlier in the course, Arek Stopczynski referred to data collection as being expensive. Carefully review the data sources already available, as well as potential new sources of data. You will need to balance the need for trusted, high-accuracy data or low-grain data with the costs and overheads associated with obtaining the data. In many cases, your pilot project will focus on easier-to-obtain data, and you may need to use proxies or subsets of data to demonstrate the usefulness of the concept being studied. Many of the questions that you will need to answer may potentially be answered using a small subset of data (this concept is known as the [Pareto principle](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoprinciple.asp). There would typically be a number of use cases for the same set of data. Think of social network data. While many organizations, or units within organizations, are excited about the prospect of using this rich source of data, few are able to obtain value from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2 Data preparation\n",
    "Data preparation can be a tedious process, and typically requires more time than is budgeted for. Accelerators aid in transformation, and the governance of data can help you to reduce ongoing required efforts. When thinking about the creation of data products or implementing production systems, you should typically want to automate these steps, in order to free up capacity of your data scientists, ensuring that they can spend their time on useful tasks rather than repetitive ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.3 Analytics\n",
    "In addressing analytics concerns, you would build up a \"toolbox\" as you practise and implement your analytics capabilities. These may include:\n",
    "- Statistical analyses and predictive modeling, including generalized linear models (GLMs), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification algorithms, and naive bayes models to train models for churn prediction;\n",

    "> **Review**: Section 5 of the referenced paper.\n",

    "The focus of the provided paper is on the mobile phone platform. It defines the sensors used, and describes the data formats, data movement protocols, and the data storage structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **system architecture** is a conceptual model that defines and describes the technical components contained in the system structure, as well as the system’s behavior. It is typically used for planning and communication purposes when the components need to be described to interested parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, you would want to create a system that delivers fast and scalable results, and the components selected will vary greatly, based on available existing resources as well as new requirements and options. Often, you would start with a conceptual or logical model that describes the functions and flow of information in the system. At a later stage of the process, you would revisit granular details such as the physical implementation and specific components that were used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people get stuck when trying to select the technology first, then extending and revisiting the logical and conceptual models at later stages. This approach carries the risk of diluting the project’s purpose, and getting lost in technicalities rather than focusing on the defined purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy considerations will be addressed in the second notebook of this module. However, at this stage, it is important to note that traditional methods that are applied to anonymize data in relational or file-based systems are usually no longer adequate. This necessitates approaches such as “privacy by design” to ensure that you deal with sensitive and potentially-sensitive data appropriately. Consider data collected for internal and external use. Your internal researchers may require access to granular and unmasked data, while other business users or applications may only need to access anonymized data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While the technical components of systems architecture fall outside of the scope of this course, the following section briefly outlines a number of items that you should carefully consider when defining your architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.1 Dealing with data\n",
    "Consider the following points regarding dealing with data before defining your target system architecture:\n",
    "1. **Sourced data can be stored as files or in dedicated structures (such as databases):** These databases can either be relational or non-relational, and their physical implementation should be based on function and cost considerations. A number of implementation alternatives exist, and you can review two of the most popular structures – logical data warehouses and data lakes.\n",
    "2. **Interacting with the data can be done via a wide variety of tools:** The choice of technology will determine the available options. The data can be accessed via BI tools, Excel, SQL, or application program interfaces (APIs). These concepts are not described in detail here, however, you are encouraged to perform your own research should the topics be of interest to you.\n",
    "3. **Data governance and data definitions need to be maintained over time, and are typically of use to multiple stakeholders in your organization:** While controlling these in the analytics phase often ensures quick time-to-action, it is important to hand these over to stable structures to avoid having to repeat the actions on an ongoing basis. The advantage of this approach is that you will start building rich, \"trusted\" data structures that you can access for future use cases. In addition to this, your insights can start to form part of the internal reporting structures for your organization (if they exist).\n",
    "4. **Methodologies applied in traditional BI approaches are usually based on waterfall methodologies:** Analytics projects tend to be better suited to agile or \"fail-fast\" methodologies that promote quicker time-to-value and iterative approaches. Once you have determined that your analysis holds value, you can decide on the appropriate action to implement on a more permanent basis. This is instead of committing to large projects before being able to ascertain or confirm that the project is feasible and can be implemented.\n"
