    "Madang is a province on the northern coast of Papua New Guinea. The population is estimated at 400,000, comprising of about 200 tribal languages (out of 800+ for whole of PNG's 7.2 million people), with Pidgin English being common. Although the province, like the rest of PNG is resource rich, it is largely undeveloped and poverty is rife. \n",
    "\n",
    "Madang town and port attracted the largest population (40,000); the rest of the people living in mountainous inland terrains where there are no roads, poor electricity reticulation and women have to walk for long distances to get drinking water. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is much to be done for the socio-economic development of Madang, given that some large projects for oil and gas exploration are looming. Moreover, the Madang land owners are adamant that these projects will only be allowed to proceed when benefits to advance the living standards of the people are part of the investment plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, I will pick the topic of providing water reticulation for Madang, and create the high-level social analytics blueprint (2-3 line items) for how to go about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In spite of the rough and inaccessible inland terrain, all Madang people have cell phones that are well serviced by cell phone antenna towers.\n"

    ">>*\tThe central PNG government at Port Moresby, for endorsement and support – regulatory requirements, licensing, immigration visas for skilled resources, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    ">2.Technical support – support engagement process and the service levels to ensure productivity.\n",
